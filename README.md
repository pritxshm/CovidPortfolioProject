Utilized SQL to analyze real-world Covid-19 data sourced from OurWorldinData.org/covid-deaths
Demonstrated expertise in:
1)Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and Temporary Tables.
2)Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, and Data Type Conversions.
3)Creating reusable Views for advanced analysis and visualization preparation.

Conducted key analyses, including:
1)Global Insights: Evaluated infection and mortality rates across continents and countries.
2)Risk Assessment: Analyzed total cases vs. total deaths to calculate mortality likelihoods.
3)Population Impact: Determined infection and vaccination rates relative to population size.
4)Developed metrics like "Percent of Population Infected" and "Percent of Population Vaccinated" to provide actionable insights.
5)Leveraged partitioning techniques for rolling aggregation of vaccination data.
6)Designed a comprehensive SQL View to support visualization tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau).
